# dungeon23
#dungeon23 work, all procedural
Roughly based on the alternate schedule by Spooky, this is my Dungeon23/World23 schedule,:

• Sunday — Settlement description, a village or a town. Could also be a bandit camp if that strikes your fancy 

• Monday — Environment description. Think the local weather, geology, flora and fauna 

• Tuesday — Settlement description 

• Wednesday — Culture description of something fun or interesting about the local people. Something to make them stand out 

• Thursday — NPC description, someone important or interesting on the island 

• Friday — Faction description of either a new or existing faction. Be sure to make ties between factions and peoples 

• Saturday — A rumour about something from the past week
